'termsize' is a simple program to adjust number of 'cols' and 'rows' associated with
controlling terminal '/dev/tty' so to match the actual size of attached terminal (emulator window).

Typical/intended use is when attaching over UART/RS232 to a remote computer that initially
has default number cols and rows (often 80x25). Running the program on the
remote computer adjusts the number of cols and rows, for its local tty device,
to current number of cols and rows.
